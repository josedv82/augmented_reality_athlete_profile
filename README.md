# Athlete Physical Dashboard via Augmented Reality
Simple proof of concept app combining image recognition via ARkit and a swiftUI view to display athlete metrics. The goal is to recognize an image in the real world and overlay a dashboard (in this case, an athlete profile card) specific to that image.

# Code

[SwiftUI View](https://github.com/josedv82/augmented_reality_athlete_profile/blob/master/SwiftUIViewARCardView.swift)

[ViewController](https://github.com/josedv82/augmented_reality_athlete_profile/blob/master/ViewController.swift)

# Future Work

* Similar process with multiple images/athletes.
